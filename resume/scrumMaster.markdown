title: Stephan Schwab - Scrum Master
---
During most engagements I am the [Agile Coach](technicalTeamCoach.html) or a [consultant](consultant.html). In those cases where the Scrum method has been chosen and no suitable member of the organization I am coaching can be found I act as interim Scrum Master.

In the [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) the [Scrum Master](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-sm) is described as follows:

> The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.

> The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which arenâ€™t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.
