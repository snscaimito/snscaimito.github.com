When it comes to dealing with complexity in todays global dynamic markets the best people can be described as <em>generalizing specialists</em>. That is not a "jack in all trades" but someone with broad knowledge and experience with very deep knowledge in some areas. Such a person can deal best with complexity and recognize and react to potential threats quickly and decisively.

This profile highlights my experience as **Consultant**.
