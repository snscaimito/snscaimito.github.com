## **Client**: Caimito Services LLC  
**Duration**: 2024  
**Objective**:  
Develop a tool to assist in the planning and design of agroforestry systems, enabling efficient research and visualization of plant species properties for optimized layouts.

---

### **Solution**:  
- Extensively utilized **ChatGPT** for research on plant species, properties, and ecosystem compatibility to inform application functionality.  
- Integrated **GitHub Copilot** in **VS Code** to rapidly prototype and iterate on the tool's development tasks.  
- Adopted **trunk-based development**, pushing commits and changes directly to the production environment to ensure continuous updates and delivery.  
- Built the **backend** with **Spring Boot** for processing and business logic.  
- Designed a lightweight, efficient **frontend** using **Thymeleaf** templates combined with **htmx** for dynamic interactivity without requiring a full JavaScript framework.

---

### **Outcome**:  
- Successfully delivered an agroforestry planning tool to support informed decision-making for planting strategies.  
- Accelerated development cycles with the combination of AI tools (**ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**) and trunk-based development.  
- Improved performance and simplicity by using an **HTML5/CSS3** approach with **htmx**, eliminating the need for heavy frontend frameworks.

---

### **Technologies Used**:  
- **Backend**: Spring Boot  
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf, htmx, HTML5/CSS3  
- **AI Tools**: ChatGPT for research and development acceleration  
- **Code Assistance**: GitHub Copilot in VS Code  
- **Development Practice**: Trunk-Based Development

---

### **Key Contributions**:  
- Researched plant species and optimized application functionality using **ChatGPT**.  
- Rapidly prototyped the tool’s features with **GitHub Copilot**, significantly reducing development time.  
- Built a robust backend with **Spring Boot** and an interactive, lightweight frontend using **htmx**.  
- Established a continuous delivery workflow with trunk-based development practices.
