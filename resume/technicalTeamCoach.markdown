title: Stephan Schwab - Technical Team Coach
---
When it comes to dealing with complexity in todays global dynamic markets the best people can be described as <em>generalizing specialists</em>. That is not a "jack in all trades" but someone with broad knowledge and experience with very deep knowledge in some areas. Such a person can deal best with complexity and recognize and react to potential threats quickly and decisively.

This profile highlights my experience as **Technical Team Coach**.

<dl class="resume">

		<p>Introduced and coached implementation teams on ATDD and Specification by Example.

		<p>Introduced and coached implementation teams on flow-based development and the use of a coaching map to improve their own value creation. Introduced the use of controlled experiments to base decisions on facts and avoid premature commitment.</p>

	<dt>Software Development Coach at Webtrekk</dt>
	<dd><p>September 2013 - June 2014, Germany</p>

	<dt>Software Development Coach at OBI Smart Technologies</dt>

		<p>Originally I was hired as an interim Scrum Master (5 days/week) for a development team working on an internal master data management system written in Visual Basic 6. As the team was comprised of programmers only, I began working to convey to management the need for cross-functional collaboration. Based on my recommendation the company added dedicated testers to the development effort and I helped to select suitable candidates.</p>
		<p>I recreated my role to become more a Value Stream Improvement Coach across departments in order to bring people along the value chain together and thus improve it. As part of that I also reduced my physical presence to 2 days/week in order to permit my coachees to develop independence.</p>
		<p>For several projects I coached business analysts on how to conduct workshops with business units to discover requirements and use Story Mapping and Specification by Example to convey details to the programming team.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Over the course of the engagement I introduced people to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Executable Specification</li>
			<li>Unit Testing in VB 6 and VB.Net</li>
			<li>Cucumber (Ruby), Savon, RAutomation</li>
			<li>SpecFlow (.Net, C#)</li>
