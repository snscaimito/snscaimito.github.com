### **Objective**:  
Develop and maintain a **NodeJS-based API** to orchestrate external services efficiently, ensuring scalability and robust testing for a globally distributed application.

---

### **Solution**:  
- Implemented the API using **NodeJS** and a **functional programming style** with **Promises** and **lodash/fp** for cleaner, modular code.  
- Integrated external services such as **OneSignal** for notifications and **Firebase** for backend support.  
- Established a robust **testing strategy**:  
   - **Unit Testing**: Conducted with **Jest** for fast, isolated tests.  
   - **Acceptance and Smoke Testing**: Automated using **Cucumber.js** and **Chai** to ensure end-to-end reliability.  
- Collaborated within a **geographically distributed team**, coordinating across time zones with team members in Europe, Japan, and the USA.  

---

### **Outcome**:  
- Successfully delivered a scalable and reliable API to orchestrate external services.  
- Improved code quality and maintainability through **functional programming principles**.  
- Ensured high software reliability and reduced deployment risk with automated unit, acceptance, and smoke testing.  
- Enabled seamless collaboration among globally distributed team members.

---

### **Technologies Used**:  
- **Backend**: NodeJS, JavaScript  
- **Programming Style**: Functional Programming, Promises, lodash/fp  
- **Testing**: Jest, Cucumber.js, Chai  
- **Integrations**: OneSignal, Firebase  

---

### **Key Contributions**:  
- Developed and maintained the API using modern **NodeJS** practices.  
- Wrote comprehensive **unit tests** with Jest and automated **end-to-end tests** using Cucumber.js and Chai.  
- Applied functional programming techniques to improve code clarity and maintainability.  
- Collaborated effectively within a **distributed international team** to ensure project success.
