<h1>My professional experience - Engagements</h1>

When it comes to dealing with complexity in todays global dynamic markets the best people can be described as <em>generalizing specialists</em>. That is not a "jack in all trades" but someone with broad knowledge and experience with very deep knowledge in some areas. Such a person can deal best with complexity and recognize and react to potential threats quickly and decisively.

<strong>I usually don't work as an employee</strong> earning a salary except for technical reasons on a rare occasion. For that reason all the engagements listed here have been either as contractor or external consultant. I rather prefer to help my clients and customers by keeping the <strong>spirit and perspective of an entrepreneur and businessman</strong>.
