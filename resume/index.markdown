**Agile Coach / Scrum Coach**

**Scrum Master**

**Software Development Coach & Consultant**

**Interim Manager**

I help CEOs and Department Leaders to improve value creation and cohesion within their organization. The outcome will be higher quality, customer delight and more revenue. 

Agility and self-organization require technical competence. Scrum, Kanban and other frameworks and concepts do not work without technical abilities. I help everybody involved to acquire or grow these abilities.

My contributions help the organization to become more adaptable and more resilient so that it can prevail in global dynamic markets that are constantly changing.

My work, on an international level, gets me in touch with many different national and corporate cultures. That allows me to see the bigger picture, provides me a large arsenal of tools and therefore makes me able to solve difficult situations in a way that is new to the particular client I’m working with.
