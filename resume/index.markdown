# My professional experience - Overview
My main specialty is to help others learn, explore and grow in a safe and effective way to improve how they contribute to the success of the organization they serve. I can sit with a programmer and help coding and I can also help managers with project management or the work flow in the groups they are responsible for.

**Note to recruiters:** Despite all my technical experience you will find in my profile here and elsewhere, I am not available for any fulltime positions. I provide professional services through my company [Caimito Technologies](http://www.caimito.net).

## Professional interests
Collaboration between technical people and those in close contact with the actual market and customers is becoming more important as the world becomes more complex and customers have increasingly more choices.

I like to help **technical teams**, those who implement, create, make a product, to **collaborate better with discovery teams**, those who figure out what a customer might want and define requirements for the implementors.

## Facets
As a [T-shaped person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) I don't identify myself with a single activity. So what I do during my wake hours of any given day can best be described as facets. Some facets are:

	<dt>Consultant</dt>

	</dd>

	<dd>
		<p>I do my own web design for this site and also my <a href="http://www.caimito.net">company's website</a>.</p>
		<p>In the domain of physical things I have designed my own <a href="/2010/01/07/nice-doors-and-final-paint-job-for-the-offroad-trailer.html">custom-built offroad trailer</a> and also a <a href="/2010/03/10/building-a-temporary-horse-stable.html">temporary horse stable</a>.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Developer</dt>
	<dd>

	<dt>Pilot</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>In 1989 I earned my Private Pilot License (PPL) for single engine piston aircraft. After not using it for about 17 years I reactivated it in 2013 for doing <a href="/airtravel">business trips</a>, and sometimes for leisure, throughout Europe in a light aircraft.</p>
		<p>In April 2014 I <a href="/2014/04/13/instrument-rated-pilot.html">added an instrument rating</a> to my license. That allows me to improve my dispatch rate and to <a href="/2014/04/29/ifr-edfc-edaz.html">perform flights in less than perfect weather</a>. It is also a much safer form of air travel.</p>
