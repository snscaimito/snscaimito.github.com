My focus is on value creation from the customer's point of view. At the very end it's the customer who pays everybody's salary.

I help others to learn, explore and grow in a safe and effective way to improve how they contribute to the success of the organization they serve. I can sit with a programmer and help coding and I can also help managers with project management or the work flow in the groups they are responsible for. I can also be that manager for a while.

				<p>Created training material for the internal consulting organization and traveled to Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Xian to engage in training/coaching and meetings with various levels of management.</p>
				<p>Introduced and coached implementation teams on ATDD and Specification by Example. These teams work on Android based mobile phones, softswitch systems for telecom carriers, embedded traffic shaping and monitoring systems. Depending on the language used by the testers on the team Cucumber C++ or Behave for Python together with Appium was used to create an executable specification.</p>
				<p>Introduced and coached implementation teams on flow-based development and the use of a coaching map to improve their own value creation. Introduced the use of controlled experiments to base decisions on facts and avoid premature commitment.</p>

			<dd>
				<p>Originally I was hired as an interim Scrum Master (5 days/week) for a development team working on an internal master data management system written in Visual Basic 6. As the team was comprised of programmers only, I began working to convey to management the need for cross-functional collaboration. Based on my recommendation the company added dedicated testers to the development effort and I helped to select suitable candidates.</p>
				<p>I recreated my role to become more a Value Stream Improvement Coach across departments in order to bring people along the value chain together and thus improve it. As part of that I also reduced my physical presence to 2 days/week in order to permit my coachees to develop independence.</p>
				<p>For several projects I coached business analysts on how to conduct workshops with business units to discover requirements and use Story Mapping and Specification by Example to convey details to the programming team.</p>
