title: The attempt to acquire land and set up a farm in the rainforest of Panama
---
Between September 2009 and August 2010 I attempted to acquire 130 hectars of land in Eastern Panama near Lake Bayano. 

The land in question was under right of possession, which means that there is a user but not an owner of the land. What is being purchased is the right to possess the land and the purchase price is supposed to reflect the investment the former user has made into improving the land. The improvements to be paid are things like fences, special pasture for cows, a house or other structures, etc. 

Some in Panama treat right of possession the same was as a title to the land. Titled land is a property that can be sold and the purchase price is for the land itself.

Unfortunately it was not possible to resolve the legal issues and so at the end we had to abandon the project.
