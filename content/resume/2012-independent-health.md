### **Objective**:  
Coach **SOA teams** on adopting **Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)** and deliver a technical tool to automate testing for **IBM MQ Series**.

---

### **Solution**:

#### **ATDD Coaching for SOA Teams**  
- Coached **team leaders and SOA teams** on adopting **Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)** to align development with business requirements.  
- Provided hands-on sessions and examples to demonstrate the benefits of writing acceptance tests before implementation.  
- Enabled teams to integrate ATDD practices into their workflows, improving collaboration and software quality.  

#### **Development of rmq**  
- Identified a need for a **testing tool** to interact with **IBM MQ Series** for automated testing within ATDD processes.  
- Developed **rmq**, a lightweight **Ruby wrapper** around the MQ Series client API, enabling teams to:  
   - Send and receive messages programmatically for automated testing.  
   - Validate message flows and integration points within the SOA architecture.  
- Delivered the tool as part of the engagement, ensuring it was simple to use and effective for testing IBM MQ Series integrations.

---

### **Outcome**:  
- Successfully enabled SOA teams to adopt **ATDD**, leading to improved test coverage and reduced integration issues.  
- Delivered **rmq**, a custom-built Ruby tool for testing IBM MQ Series, which simplified and automated message testing.  
- Equipped teams with practical tools and techniques to improve their **testing workflows** and integration reliability.
