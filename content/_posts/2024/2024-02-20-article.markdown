Social media sites and networks are great for conversations and help information to be distributed quickly. However, whatever one posts there, as quickly as it was posted, disappears from view and it is hard to find later as well.

After building myself a little script that allows me to [post automatically to social media services](/2024/02/10/article.html) I am now working on further improvements to my whole blogging experience.

Currently this blog runs as GitHub Pages and is served from GitHub as a bunch of static HTML files. GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to turn a bunch of YAML files and templates into HTML files that can be served from the simplest of all web servers with minimal load.

I don't want to change that simplicity.
