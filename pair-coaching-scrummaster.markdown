title: Scrum Masters - Pair Coach with me
---
The following is an offer for Scrum Masters who either have no technical background, have been out of the technical area for quite a while or decided to focus on non-technical areas.

As a Scrum Master you are trying everything possible to help your team and the organization to become better at what they do. You help them to improve. You help them to understand how they create value and you help them to keep the customer in their focus.

## Self-organization requires technical competence
Allow me to refer to a book written by a submarine captain who was given command of the worst ship in the fleet. While he was in command the ship became one of the best and continues to be one of the best even though the captain is now someone else.

The captain is David Marquet who wrote *Turn the Ship Around!* in 2012. His idea was to divest control and distribute it instead of being the only one who controls everything. He did on a submarine a lot of things that we are aiming for with Scrum on Software Development teams.

<blockquote>
	<p>One of the two pillars that support control is competence. Competence means that people are technically competent to make the decisions they make.</p>

</blockquote>

Self-organization, distributed leadership and many other nice ideas will not work at all, if the people you are trying to empower simply don't have the skills to carry out what you would like them to do or what they want themselves.

Captain Marquet **invested into technical education** for the people under his command so that **eventually** he was **able to delegate control** to them and have them self-organize.

## Let's help people to grow technical competence
One of the five features of a [Learning Organization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_organization) is **Personal Mastery**. To gain mastery in a craft one needs to have an **opportunity to learn from others outside the own shop**. Learning from people outside the own shop helps to get to know new perspectives, discover new techniques and approaches to solving a problem, allows to see where the bar in the field is currently set at, and many other positive inspirations can come from it.

In [my own work](/resume/engagements.html) I'm like a little butterfly picking up techniques and methods [all over the world](/resume/index.html). That allows me to apply and hone my technical skills in many different environments. 

## The Scrum Challenge
One particular skill that is pretty important for Scrum teams is to **be able to deliver a shipable product increment at the end of each sprint**. The Scrum Guide says:

<blockquote>
	<p>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,” which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.” It must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually release it.</p>

Amongst many other things a useful method to help with that is [Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)](/atdd/). It is an old method that was first described in 1957. Together with its more widely known sibling Test-Driven Development (TDD) this method not only helps to deliver code that works but also helps to develop the right product.

## We can help your team together
Are you interested in delivering the promise of Scrum and grow your team's technical competence with me? 

**You are the master of Scrum** and **I can help your team on their technical challenges.** For example, I can sit with individual members of the team and pair program teaching test-driven development in difficult situations. I can help the testers come up with automation to free time for more meaningful tasks. I can be their technical sparrings partner to let them bounce technical ideas off of me. I can help them evaluate a new framework or other new technology or share my experience with a framework that I made elsewhere. There are many things in the technical area where I can **support your work** as Scrum Master.

As I have no interest in working myself as Scrum Master - my business is different - you can use me as a **trusted partner** to bring in for special occasions. Due to my long-term international experience we may even talk about your own challenges with the organization outside your Scrum team and I may be able to provide you some insights.
