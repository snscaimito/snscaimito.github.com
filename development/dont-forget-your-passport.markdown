These days travelers are frequently asked to provide some sort of identification. What used to be a question of paying someone for moving your body and belongings from one place to another has somehow become something else.

If you get into your car, you turn the ignition key and start driving whereever you want to go. You are your own transport provider and nobody wants to know who you are.

If you want to to use the train for your travel, you buy a ticket and get on a car. Someone may check the validity of the ticket but you will not be asked who you are.

If you want to travel by air, an important thing changes. Unlike in a train people and seats are matched. In the train you can take any empty seat or even decide to stand during the journey. On an airline flight a seat is assigned to you and the pilot receives a copy of the load manifest where the cargo and passengers are listed. Passengers are listed by name and assigned seat.

--- why is that? icao / iata rules? since when?


If you need to cross an international border between two countries, you will be asked to present your passport so that both countries can know who is leaving and entering. Some border control agent may decide not to let you leave or enter.




I needed to go on a two day trip from Shenzhen to Beijing. I had booked a round-trip ticket with Air China. When I arrived at the Shenzhen airport I discovered that I didn't have my passport with me. I left it in our temporary apartment with my family. Going back to get the passport would have meant to miss the flight. 

## Shenzhen to Beijing
I went to the Air China counter and presented my German identification card. It does show my picture and is what is commonly called a *government issued photo ID*. The Air China staff deemed that enough for boarding one of their aircraft, looked up my name to find the ticket and printed the boarding pass.

As I didn't have any luggage for this two trip, I proceeded directly to the gate. As is common these days in most place there is a security inspection to pass. So I queued up and when it was my turn I presented by German ID card together with the boarding pass. I was asked about my passport and responded that I forgot it. The security agent looked up the boarding pass in their system, found it valid, put a rubber stamp on it and I was allowed to proceed.

So I let my bag go through x-ray, step through the metal detector and get manually checked for metal manually as well. In China they check ID and boarding pass again after that and so someone else, without access to a computer, looks at the boarding pass and the German ID. This person also asks for my passport and says that I cannot fly without a passport.

My response was that I have a valid boarding pass and a *government issued photo ID* and am not boarding an international flight. Two or three of the security people discuss the situation and tell me again that I need a passport for a domestic flight. So I ask them to call their supervisor. The supervisor arrives, concludes the same and someone is told to take me back to the other side.

I continue to insist that I have all necessary documents to travel. Another, higher ranking, supervisor then arrives and checks my boarding pass and the German ID. This supervisor now asks for my Chinese visa. I explain that it is, of course, stamped into the passport, which I don't have with me. But I offer him to see the invitation letter on which the visa is based. He looks at the PDF on my iPad and eventually concluses that I can travel. So the other supervisor looks at his watch and helps me quickly through security to catch my flight to Beijing.

## First night in Beijing
After work I take a taxi to the hotel for the night. At the front desk I present my credit card, the hotel chain membership card and they look up my reservation. Then they ask for my passport and I hand them my German ID. Another staff member is consulted and they make a photocopy of the German ID and I get the room key.

## Beijing to Shenzhen
After work I take a taxi to the Beijing airport. I find the Air China counter and based on my German ID I get the boarding pass for the return flight to Shenzhen. I enter the security queue after a machine read the barcode on my boarding pass and wait until a human again checks the validity of my boarding pass by reading the barcode and let the computer display something to him. I get asked about my passport and after my explanation (passport is back in Shenzhen, government issued photo ID) the person rubber stamps my boarding pass and I continue to the queue in front of the X-ray machine.

Now someone shows up and asks me to come back. Where my passport is was the question. I explain and get told that I needed a passport for the domestic flight. A supervisor is called and he decides to call someone from Air China to clarify.

The Air China staff member arrives and I explain that I would like to use the service I paid for and that security is not an international border where a passport would be required. I show to both of them the boarding pass from yesterday's flight where I had flown on Air China from Shenzhen to Beijing and ask them why the highest ranking supervisor in Shenzhen allowed me to travel. I show them pictures of my passport and the Chinese visa but they explain that I can only travel with my passport. So I ask them how I would be able to go where my passport is to retrieve it. They say they don't know the answer to that.

So I ask for a higher ranking supervisor. Someone with the same three stripes on the should shows up and he is not really interested. No passport, no travel is the message. So I ask for his boss and he doesn't speak any English any more. The Air China staff member has to translate and she is not getting anywhere.

In the end I agree to this back to the supervisor of Air China. She takes me to her boss and while we are talking he cancels my ticket. I object and explain that I never asked for my ticket to be canceled. The answer is that regulations require them to cancel a ticket when airport security does not allow a person to travel.

As I insist that they either reactivate my ticket or refund it at the spot, they call someone with better English skills.

That person offers to help me to solve the problem and goes back to security with me. So we show the rubber stamped boarding pass and my German ID to the security person at the entrance and ask for a supervisor. One two stripe person shows up and she decides that she cannot decide. The Air China staff member asks her to get the real supervisor and they both go to find the person. When they come back I learn that it was the same supervisor who didn't want to call his boss. When I asked who is supervisor was he answered that his boss is the Civil Aviation Administration.

As this is going nowhere the English speaking guy from Air China thinks about helping me to use the high-speed train from Beijing to Shenzhen but after some thought he says that for that I will have to have my passport as well.

The boarding time approaches and suddenly he takes me to a counter where they issue temporary IDs. It turns out that it only works for Chinese citizens. But at least it was worth a try.

## German embassy
So I accept that I'm not going to fly to Shenzhen tonight and decide to call the German embassy. They explain that it would be no problem to provide me a new passport but then the problem would be that I would have to apply for a new Chinese visa.

I decide that I want to find a hotel and tell them they can find me at the Hilton hotel right there at the airport.

## No room without passport at Hilton
A few minutes later I arrive at the Hilton airport hotel to ask for a room. I present a credit card and my Hilton Honors membership card. In response to the question for my passport I present my German ID. Unlike at the other hotel where I spent the night before the staff does not make a photocopy of my ID but calls their supervisor.

The supervisor explains to me that they cannot rent me a room without my passport. The staff member shows her my Hilton Honors membership card but that doesn't help.

I explain that I don't understand why I need a passport to rent a room from Hilton and ask whether they expect me to sleep on the street with a friendly smile. She then says she has to call someone and will be back shortly.

When she returns she explains that I should go to my embassy or to some immigration office in the airport. There they would create a "certificate" and with that they can rent me a room. She goes on to explain many times that currently security were very important due to some conference in town.

She then arranges for one of the bellboys to take me to the immigration office in the airport. The guy gets with me on the shuttle bus. As we arrive at the airport the bellboy goes straight to an information counter and the lady there wants to know where I lost my passport. I explain that I didn't loose anything and ask the bellboy why we are not going to the office as he was instructed. Instead of giving an answer he approaches a police officer and they talk about something. The police officer doesn't know the answer and walks away.

I ask the bellboy again to take me to the office and he agrees. We walk and to my surprise we end up on the parking lot at the shuttle bus. There he explains that we need to go back to the hotel. I ask him to call the front desk manager on his phone. It then turns out that there is no immigration office. I tell her that she made a bad business decision and decide to go a different hotel in the center of Beijing where I stayed a few days before.
