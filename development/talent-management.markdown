Agile is about collaboration

Freelancers

Employees

Recruiting specialists

Growing people

Forming a tribe / corporate culture

Two different systems / ideologies / mindset

Freelancers and employees can collaborate. But benefit and incentive schemes can get in the way creating a us-vs-them situation.
