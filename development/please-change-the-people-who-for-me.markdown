Managers create the environment people work in

THe environment shapes their behavior

Changes to the environment will make people adapt and thus change their behavior

Change to the environment requires a change of the manager's own behavior

"Please change the people who work for me" translates to "Please change my behavior and perception"

Lasting change requires alignment with people's inner motives

Managers should stop demotivation people

Management = administration, which is risk adverse by default

Entrepreneurial mindset. Risk something to gain big / investment

Coach should work with the business / the people with the responsability for profit and loss
