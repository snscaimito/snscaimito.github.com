From time to time I contribute to open source software or develop something of my own. This page holds references to these projects.

### RAutomation
RAutomation is a library to automate Windows applications for automated testing. I have contributed Ruby, C/C++ code to add support for more controls such as checkbox, radio button, list view, combobox. Besides sending Windows messages I'm using Microsoft Active Accessibility and Microsoft UI Automation via a custom C/C++ DLL.

### rmq
rmq is a wrapper library to make the C language API of IBM’s MQ product available to Ruby programmers. There has been another gem “ruby-wmq” but it was a C extension and only works with MRI Ruby. That leaves people using other Rubies like JRuby without support. Plus it appears that “ruby-wmq” is no longer supported.
