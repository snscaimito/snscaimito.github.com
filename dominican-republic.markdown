title: Several months in the Dominican Republic
---
During the year 2005 we lived for several months in the Dominican Republic. That was before I started to maintain this blog and for that reason there are no stories available here.

We had lived in Florida before and wanted to try out something different. The Dominican Republic is just a short one hour flight from Florida and it is easy and quite cheap to go from there to the U.S. to see clients.

As an example I can tell that on one occasion I flew from Santo Domingo to Fort Lauderdale for the sole purpose of buying my first Apple MacBook and I was back in the late afternoon.
