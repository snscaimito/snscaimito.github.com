title: Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)
---
Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) is a software development method that brings technical and non-technical people together to create a high-value product in collaboration with the customer. It is related to Test-Driven Development (TDD) but while TDD is code-centric and focuses on the inside of the software (how the code solves the problem) ATDD can be described as outside-in with the focus on the software's behavior. It is about what the software does to solve a problem.

This page is supposed to provide an overview and provide pointers to more material about ATDD.
