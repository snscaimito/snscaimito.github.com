# Using a light aircraft for business travel within Europe
After living several years in Panama and traveling back and forth between Panama and many cities in the United States - at some point even on a weekly basis - I've become quite used to air travel. Now that we have relocated back to Europe I'm trying to pick up an old thing and figure out whether I can make use of it to serve clients all across Europe instead of limiting my business to a certain area.

In the 1990s I had a few opportunities to use a light aircraft for business travel. It was a pleasant experience, saved time and wasn't that expensive given the alternatives.

There are so many airports within Germany and all across Europe that you will find one every few kilometers. The following map shows airports and airfields for different types of aircraft in Germany.

That seems plenty enough.

What follows is an unordered list of articles with thoughts and discoveries as I research this topic.

## Flying is not as easy as driving
During the 1990s I learnt to fly a glider aircraft, like the [ASK-21](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleicher_ASK_21), and single engine piston aircraft, like [Cessna 172](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172) or [Piper PA-28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28). I have accumulated about 280 hours of being the pilot in command on these types of aircraft until 1997. In that time I have landed and taken off at small and large airports in Germany, Belgium, Austria, Hungary and Florida, USA under VFR (visual flight rules) during daytime.

Learning to fly and operate an aircraft safely is not for everyone but it isn't any more difficult than to drive a powerful car. In both cases some understanding of what it entails is required. Staying calm and being able to perform controlled action is another important factor to avoid an accident.

## Why I stopped flying
Before 1997 I was renting a [Piper PA-28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28) at very favorable terms that fit within my budget as a student. It has been a hobby - albeit slightly expensive - but I had to need to travel a lot. I relocated to a different city and access to the inexpensive PA-28 became difficult. As a consequence the expensive hobby became just that and without much need for travel, I eventually dropped it.

## Thanks
A very valuable source of information and insight have been the pilots participating in the conversations at the forum of [Pilot und Flugzeug](http://www.pilotundflugzeug.de).
