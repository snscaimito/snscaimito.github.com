# Using a light aircraft for business travel within Europe
After living several years in Panama and traveling back and forth between Panama and many cities in the United States - at some point even on a weekly basis - I've become quite used to air travel. Now that we have relocated back to Europe I'm trying to pick up an old thing and figure out whether I can make use of it to serve clients all across Europe instead of limiting my business to a certain area.

In the 1990s I had a few opportunities to use a light aircraft for business travel. It was a pleasant experience, saved time and wasn't that expensive given the alternatives.

There are so many airports within Germany and all across Europe that you will find one every few kilometers. The following map shows airports and airfields for different types of aircraft in Germany.

That seems plenty enough.

What follows is an unordered list of articles with thoughts and discoveries as I research this topic.

* [Airport fees](airport-fees.html)

### Performing flights

## Others have made similar research or tell about their experiences

## Flying is not as easy as driving
During the late 1980s I learnt to fly a glider aircraft, like the [ASK-21](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleicher_ASK_21), and single engine piston aircraft, like [Cessna 172](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172) or [Piper PA-28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28). I have accumulated about 280 hours of being the pilot in command on these types of aircraft until 1997. In that time I have landed and taken off at small and large airports in Germany, Belgium, Austria, Hungary and Florida, USA under VFR (visual flight rules) during daytime.

Learning to fly and operate an aircraft safely is not for everyone but it isn't any more difficult than to drive a powerful car. In both cases some understanding of what it entails is required. Staying calm and being able to perform controlled action is another important factor to avoid an accident.

## Why I stopped flying
Before 1997 I was renting a [Piper PA-28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-28) at very favorable terms that fit within my budget as a student. It has been a hobby - albeit slightly expensive - but I had to need to travel a lot. I relocated to a different city and access to the inexpensive PA-28 became difficult. As a consequence the expensive hobby became just that and without much need for travel, I eventually dropped it.

## Thanks
A very valuable source of information and insight have been the pilots participating in the conversations at the forum of [Pilot und Flugzeug](http://www.pilotundflugzeug.de) as well at the pan-european forum [EuroGA](http://www.euroga.org). In case you might wonder: "GA" stands usually for General Aviation, which is every type of aviation outside the airlines and the military.

## Reports From Actually Doing It
Since reactivating my license to pilot an aircraft in April 2013 I have performed a number of VFR flights for business purposes within Germany. During summer that was relatively easy. I have learned a number of things but not yet found the time to condense them into an article.

In late August 2013 an opportunity for a much greater undertaking showed up: [Visiting the ALE2013 conference in Bucharest, Romania](/2013/09/01/ALE2013-Ostrava.html):

* [First leg Egelsbach, Germany, to Ostrava, Czech Republic](/travel/aviation/2013/09/01/ALE2013-Ostrava.html)
* [Second leg Ostrava, Czech Republic, to Szeged, Hungary](/travel/aviation/2013/09/02/ALE2013-Ostrava-Szeged.html)
* [Third leg Szeged, Hungary, to Bucharest, Romania](/travel/aviation/2013/09/03/ALE2013-Szeged-Bucharest.html)
* [Forth leg Szeged, Hungary, to Mühldorf, Germany](/travel/aviation/2013/09/05/ALE2013-Szeged-Muehldorf.html)
* Fifth leg Mühldorf, Germany, back to Egelsbach, Germany

The attempt of getting to Bucharest failed due to weather. It was clear from the beginning that being a VFR pilot is quite limiting but it was worth a try nonetheless.

## Being Instrument Rated Is Necessary
There really is no doubt that being an instrument rated (IR) pilot is necessary when using an aircraft for business travel. I have started my IR training and if all goes well will be able to perform IFR flights in a few months. However, even with an instrument rating and a good IFR capable aircraft the weather still can set limits and cause you to cancel a flight. Even commercial airlines are subject to that.
