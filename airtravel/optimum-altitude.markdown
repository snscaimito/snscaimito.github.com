# Choosing the right altitude
A light aircraft as the [Cirrus SR22](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_SR22) comes in two versions. One has a normally aspirated piston engine with a service ceiling of 17,000ft. The other is turbo normalized, which means that the same power is available at any altitude. The turbo models can fly as high as 25,000ft.
