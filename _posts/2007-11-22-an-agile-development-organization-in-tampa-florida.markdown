<p>On Monday, 19th of November 2007, I had the opportunity to speak to about 35 members of the Tampa Java Users Group. As promised to the members of the Tampa JUG, I'm offering here the presentation as PDF for <a href="http://www.stephan-schwab.com/files/AgileDevelopmentOrganizationTampa.pdf">download</a>.</p>

<p>Many thanks to all of you for the warm welcome and the interesting dialog we had during and after the presentation. I really enjoyed being with you to talk about Agile and our tool <a href="http://www.caimito.net">Savila</a>.</p>
