There is no solution yet to the <a href="http://rainforestfinca.wordpress.com/2009/12/07/agreements-are-not-always-honored-by-all-parties/">legal issues we are facing</a>. After some more analysis our initial approach of using the simple way though the <em>corregiduria</em> has turned out to be not very promising. So I decided to contract a specialist for the task and retained a lawyer who has been authoring parts of the law governing land ownership in Panama in the past. That expert is currently working the problem to get it solved quickly and hopefully before Christmas.
