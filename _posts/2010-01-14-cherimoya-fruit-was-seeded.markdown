Our little <a href="http://blog.stephan-schwab.com/2009/12/30/setting-up-a-tree-nursery/">tree nursery</a> got a new addition: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherimoya">Cherimoya</a>. Celis, our gardener, seeded some of this fruit tree and brought a few samples. He introduced it to us as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetsop">Anon</a> which is part of the same family of plants but has a different look.

That's the main issue with all these tropical plants. Depending on the country the same thing has a dozen names and of course people confuse them too. So you never know what it really is until you research it. ;-)

This is how it looks on the inside:

And this is the outside.

According to what I read this fruit is over ripe. It is ripe when the outside is green and not brownish.
