If this is not your first visit, then you remember that we were trying to <a href="/2009/09/07/figuring-out-where-to-build-an-access-road.html">figure out where to build an access road</a> to the farm. Our first attempt was unsuccessful. In July we tried again to find a suitable path through the jungle.

This where the "road" ends. Our neighbor Didimo had tried it himself. He took advantage of a bulldozer that was doing some work close by and bought a few hours from the operator. We used this way before but on horses. So this time we drove the Jeep up the point where the road ends and geared up.

Oh ... And yes, the Jeep now has a Panama license plate. It took about 6 months but now it's a native car. :-)

We looked around the corner and that's where the road might go on. Doesn't look too steep. A bulldozer can flatten it a bit. The dirt can be moved to the right and then it should be easy to drive up and on the top turn left.

So I took the camera and followed Luis who has gone ahead to clear the area where a barb wire fence blocks the way. That's what Didimo told us. Let's see ...

There is the fence. These simple barb wire fences you can find everywhere. They do not mark any farm limits but simply fence off sections so that the cattle cannot roam anywhere but stays within a certain area.
