Our horse are Criollos and due to that tough animals. They don't need any shelter or other special care. They feed on whatever they can find and as this is a tropical country there is plenty of food available. Apart of pasture they like fruits and as we've seen they go kind of crazy when mangos are available.

Still that extensive outdoor living is not without disadvantages and one issue is parasites. I'm not claiming to be a horse expert but I can tell that while we had to rely on rental horses they always lacked power and got exhausted really quick. I suspect these other horses never got treated and were suffering from internal parasites.

So to prevent that and to treat the animals that work for us well we give them injections and oral doses to protect them. Here Toby is about to receive an oral dose of ivermectin as recommended by the friendly staff of the Chepo branch of the Melo company.

Luzero gets his dose as well.

Next round is an injection. First for Toby ...

... and next for Luzero.

You may wonder where Pedron is. Pedron was suffering from a swollen hoof and some strange stuff on it. So Didimo our neighbor who looks after the horses did not attempt to cross those two rivers with a horse in that condition. We handed him Pedron's medicine and asked him to administer it to him on the farm.
