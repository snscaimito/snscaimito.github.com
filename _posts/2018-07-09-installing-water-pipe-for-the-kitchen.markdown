With the [roof watertight](/2018/06/27/water-proofing-the-roof.html) by the end of May I was able to start some plumbing work. The material used for the pipe is called *multicapa* here in Spain. It cuts easily with some sort of a knife and one can add the fittings with a crimping tool. Unlike PEX, what I was looking to use first, this pipe is only a bit flexible and you cannot bend it around a corner. Corners need L-shaped pieces to connect two segments of pipe.

The wholes in the studs are drilled with a 26 mm drill bit to make room for the 20 mm pipe.

Almost done. The kitchen area has a cold water pipe on the bottom and a hot water pipe on top. The cold water pipe offers connections for a dishwasher, the sink, and the washing machine.
