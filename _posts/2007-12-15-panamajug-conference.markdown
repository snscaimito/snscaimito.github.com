<p>Thursday and Friday of this week we presented at the first PanamaJUG conference in Chitre. This event, as I <a href="/2007/09/01/1188670188321.html">announced</a> in September, marks a big milestone in the development of the Panamanian JUG and in the work of Aristides Villareal who is professor at the regional center Azuero of Universidad Tecnologica in Los Santos.</p>

<p>Attendence was very good. We had between 50 - 80 attendees, many of them students. It was not a free event. They each paid $35 for students and $50 for professionals to cover the costs of the conference center, meals and equipment.</p>

<p>Fidel Chavarria, developer at my company <a href="http://www.caimito.net">Caimito Technologies</a>, presented our agile project management tool Savila and as well the Workbench, which is a compilation of tools like Continuum, Maven, Subversion and Savila pre-packaged as a VMware image and ready to use.</p>

<p>My presentation was about An Agile Organization and Scrum similar to the talks I gave earlier in <a href="/2007/11/22/1195766926900.html">Tampa</a> and <a href="/2007/11/22/1195767518086.html">Miami</a> but with slides translated into Spanish.</p>

<p>I just finished uploading some of my own <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephan-schwab/sets/72157603466202965/">pictures at Flickr</a>. A few more pictures can be found at <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/janicec">Janice Campbell</a>'s blog who is Globalization Program Manager at Sun Microsystems. Follow these links:</p>
