<p>This evening I enjoyed the forth <a href="http://www.geekfestpanama.com">Geek Fest Panama</a> and contributed with a talk about the SCRUM methodology for agile development in Spanish (<a href="/files/SCRUM-Espanol.pdf">slides as PDF</a>).</p>

After the presentations everybody started networking and talking about geeky stuff. I enjoyed very much the interest in my favorite topics (SCRUM and advanced Java development) and had some good conversations with a number of interesting people.

Lots of pictures were taken as well. I'll see where they will be posted and will then update this blog entry with some links.

**Update:** Here is a picture of me (on the left) talking with [Gerardo Nu√±ez](http://pa.linkedin.com/pub/gerardo-nunez/14/741/121) and another Panamanian about Java development.
