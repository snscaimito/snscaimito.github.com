It is the best and most intense way of getting to know other cultures. One gets to know upclose the good and pleasant things but also the ugly parts of the culture one lives temporarily in. 

It is also a good way to understand one's own culture much better. After being somewhere else one starts to see things back home from the outside and that is always eye opening.

So far I've been providing the professional service of coaching software development teams in Central America (Panama), North America (USA) and Europe (Germany). While doing it in the US I learned a good deal about Indian and Korean (work) culture as well.

In just two days my family and I will travel to China for a few months.
