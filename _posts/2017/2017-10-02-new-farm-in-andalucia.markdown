After a [failed attempt to aquire a piece of land in Panama](/2011/12/04/leaving-panama.html) a few years back we have since relocated to a number of different places and now found and purchased another farm in southern Spain. The farm is about 45 hectares in size, is located in the Cordoba province of Andalucia and is full of oak trees which produce acorns that feed the black Iberian pig.

The picture shows the rough location of the farm in front of the mountains.

Close by is a water reservoir that regulates the amount of water available downstream. The farm is located downstream.

The entrance to the farm is via a dirt road of about 2 kilometers in length. The road gets maintained by its users, is officially registered as *servidumbre* (access road) and crosses over three distinct parcels of registered land.

In front of the farm we have a creek that at the height of the summer heat was carrying quite a bit of water. We have access to this water and we also have a number of wells throughout the property.
