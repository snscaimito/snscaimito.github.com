Besides an abundance of fruits the farm counts with about seven creeks that carry water all year around. These creeks open into the Chulugandi river which borders the farm on one side. There are little fish in there as well. When it rains the high tide takes them to the river and further down they end up in the Bayano reserve.

So water supply is not a problem at all. It is very clean and fresh. Here Luis is filling a new bottle. The humidity and all the physical activity walking up and down the hilly terrain makes one sweat as you can't imagine, if you are used to a colder climate. Think of more than 80% humidity and about 30 - 32 degrees Celcius in the shade. That is 86 - 90 degrees Fahrenheit. By noon you will be wrenching out your shirt and find about four liters of sweat in it.

So it needs a lot of fluid but there is another problem. When you sweat you loose salt and minerals. Once the body lacks these you will feel tired and fatigued. So you have to replace that loss somehow. We discovered that the local supermarket carries Gatorate in powder form. That is much easier to carry. So we take fresh mountain water and mix our own refreshment. Imagine how that tastes!

During the survey we had barbeque for lunch. We cleaned the weed at a place with some fresh breeze and used a "light the bag" pack of coal. That's a quick and easy solution and disposing the burned out coal is clean.

Pedron and Toby enjoy their lunch as well. Actually our horses go crazy due to the abundance of pasture. They don't know where to start or to end. It takes some force to make them stop eating and keep walking ;-)
