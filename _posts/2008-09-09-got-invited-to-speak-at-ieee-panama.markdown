<p>IEEE Panama and Universidad Tecnologica de Panama asked me to speak at an event this Friday called <em><a href="http://www.diadelprogramadorutp.tk/">IEEE Dia del Programador</a></em>.</p>

<p>I'll be talking about Agile Development and what software craftsmen in general do and should do. The audience will consist of university students in their last year before graduation.</p>

<p>This is a similar event, although of smaller scale, as the <a href="http://www.stephan-schwab.com/2007/12/15/1197758472628.html">JUG conference</a> last year. I'm sure it will be fun. </p>
