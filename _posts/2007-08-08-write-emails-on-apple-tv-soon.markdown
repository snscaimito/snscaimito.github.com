<p>From my last trip to the US I brought home a brand new Apple TV and connected it to our big screen. It instantly found my WiFi network and started sync'ing to the Mac Mini that was connected to the TV before and now has moved to the home office. The Apple TV fulfills its duties as a big video iPod quite well and my wife loves it to not only watch movies and TV shows we download from iTunes, but also to fill our living room with Salsa rhythms. Sure it's a bit unusual to switch on the big plasma TV when all you want is listen to music. But on the other hand the cover animation used as a screensaver is nice and makes us switch to another track because we remember it by seeing the cover of the album it is on. So all in all the Apple TV is a nice addition and it just works.</p>

<p>Now reading my feeds I came across this:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.dailyack.com">Alasdair Allan</a> in <a href="http://www.dailyack.com/2007/08/new-imac.html">The Daily ACK: The new iMac</a>:<br>
Want to make a bet that that that refresh for the Apple TV that Steve hinted about during the Q&amp;A yesterday means that you can use this new lap-friendly lightweight keyboard to do a lot more than you used to be able to do with the Apple TV than you can now?

<p>Here is an image comparing the two keyboards:</p>

<p>The prospect of using a wireless keyboard with Apple TV is compelling. Maybe that "video iPod" gets extended to include at the very least Safari to browser web pages on the big screen. Then such a small keyboard and a wireless both would make great sense. Unfortunately the technical specifications for the current Apple TV doesn't list Bluetooth and I doubt a bit that it's already integrated, but deactivated. We'll see ;-)</p>
