To ride a horse you need a saddle. If you go into the jungle, you need a machete, Then a lasso might be useful and so are a lot of other things. All that times 3 suddenly is a lot of stuff. We spent a day going to different places to get all that.

In the picture you can see me carrying a saddle on my back for the first time in my life. Interesting feeling. I hope I won't have to carry that saddle as a sad cowboy later because something bad happened. So wish me luck. ;-)

For the next day we hired a truck to drive the horses to the farm and we were lucky enough to know someone who owns a corral with a ramp. We left all our new equipment at his home for the next morning.
