The <a href="http://rainforestfinca.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/vaccines-for-our-horses/">last time we went to Canitas</a> we were able to treat the horses Toby and Luzero but not Pedron. We handed Didimo the package of the vaccines and other medicine to treat Pedron's issue. Four days later we had another opportunity to go there in person. Currently it's a day trip to the farm from where we live because the distance is 300 km. I hope to be able to change that in the near future after other issues have been resolved.

So what's Pedron's problem. Have a look at the picture. You can see the left hoof is swollen and looks quite different than the other.

Here is a close-up. It's an open wound and the poor guy had flies all around the hoof. Nobody can tell for sure what happened to him. Some blaim it on the humidity of the soil because the area got a lot of rain. Others believe a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula">tarantula</a> had bitten him.

Anyhow he got treated with antibiotics and ...

... a special spray to maintain the his hoof dry. What looks like paint absorbs moisture.

After Pedron had been treated and released Luis offered all of us a few oranges that grow wild next to the corral. Those are not Florida oranges. They have a different more thicker flesh than regular ones.
