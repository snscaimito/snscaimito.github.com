Last Sunday was a busy day. Not only did we <a href="/2009/11/16/our-first-two-heads-of-cattle.html">bring our first two heads of cattle</a> to the farm and <a href="/2009/11/18/removing-a-large-jobo-tree-to-unblock-the-access-trail.html">removed a big "jobo" tree from the trail</a>. We did also fix the rancho a bit and cleared the area around it cutting down the weed with machetes.

Swinging the machete makes thristy. So Luis and Rigu got themselves oranges that grow right next to the rancho.

There are a few coconut trees as well. With all the weed gone it is easier to see what grows where. Kind of paradise. You step out and find coconuts next to oranges within three meters distances - don't you think?

Now it looks nice. Before we had very high grown weed right there at the door step. The trees left and right of the rancho are Mango trees. I'm looking forward to hundreds of tasty Mangos - and the horses too. They are most definitely fruit lovers as we could observe earlier. Who will say otherwise. Mango is a great fruit.

A few young coconuts. They are ready to be planted but we have to figure out how to protect them so that horses and cattle won't take a bite.

Now Luzero's and Toby's saddle and other tackle are stored in the rancho instead of in Didimo's old house. The other stuff is left-over from the person who used to work the farm several years ago. We have to go through that stuff and clean it out. We don't want to light a fire and burn these things to avoid the pollution. So we need to take it out on horseback and get rid of it the proper and clean way.

Speaking of fire. In remote areas it is still very common to use fire for everything. These people burn the brushwood and don't care about any trees before the seed new pasture. They burn waste. Whatever is in the way gets burned. Panama has an agency called ANAM that exists to prevent these environmental sins but what they don't see or what's already done ...

At least we won't use fire for anything. It's just wasteful and does more damage than good.

As this now our rancho we put a padlock in place. Luis is happy to show that this is now ours!
