<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34665899@N00/4213883556" title="View '' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" width="100" align="left" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2732/4213883556_035d4a0b48_t.jpg" height="67" hspace="10"></a> Please welcome Antonio Touri√±o to our Panama office. His current duties are mainly maintenance and administration of Unix servers (currently that is Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X), but he has also a background in database centric PHP and Java software development. A little bit of C++ adds to the mix. Antonio is bilingual (English, Spanish) and holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Evansville, USA.</p>

<p>In the picture you see Antonio in front of his workstation, which is a Dual Core <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> with a large 21" TFT display. The mini is truly a powerful tool despite the size of its enclosure. And <em>it just works</em>, so we don't have to worry about the maintenance of our most important tools. Instead we can concentrate on the work we perform for our clients.</p>

<p>Before coming to Caimito Antonio worked for <a href="http://www.giicorp.com/">GII Corp</a> in Panama as a programmer.</p>
