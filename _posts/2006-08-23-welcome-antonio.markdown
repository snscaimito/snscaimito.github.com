Please welcome Antonio Touri√±o to our Panama office. His current duties are mainly maintenance and administration of Unix servers (currently that is Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X), but he has also a background in database centric PHP and Java software development. A little bit of C++ adds to the mix. Antonio is bilingual (English, Spanish) and holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Evansville, USA.

In the picture you see Antonio in front of his workstation, which is a Dual Core <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> with a large 21" TFT display. The mini is truly a powerful tool despite the size of its enclosure. And <em>it just works</em>, so we don't have to worry about the maintenance of our most important tools. Instead we can concentrate on the work we perform for our clients.

Before coming to Caimito Antonio worked for <a href="http://www.giicorp.com/">GII Corp</a> in Panama as a programmer.
