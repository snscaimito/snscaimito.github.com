Before taking them all to the farm we used this corral to keep them over night. You can see the loading ramp and in the next picture more of the corral.

Behind the corral the owner has some pasture and a few cattle. He might have 15 or 20 heads. In the next picture you can see him giving Luzero a hair cut.

We wanted to treat our horses well. So we took them to a beauty salon before the big trip to the farm. Here you can see Luzero getting his hair trimmed. Now he is ready to impress the ladies ;-)

Allow me to introduce you to Pedron. He is making friends with Luzero. If you look closely, you can see Luzeros nose at the right.
