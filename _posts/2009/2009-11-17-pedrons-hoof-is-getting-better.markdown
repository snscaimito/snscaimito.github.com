On November 4th I reported about <a href="/2009/11/04/pedron-receives-a-house-visit-by-the-medical-team.html">our attempt at curing an issue with one of Pedron's hoofs</a>. He is getting better. The hoof is still a bit swollen but the infection was stopped and the humidity did not cause further damage.

There he is close to the rancho. He has a lot of open space to roam and enjoy great pasture on the way to the river.
