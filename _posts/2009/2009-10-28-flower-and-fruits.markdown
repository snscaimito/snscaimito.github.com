The land survey provided a great opportunity to take pictures of all the different flowers and fruits that grow naturally on the farm. Here is a selection.

In addition to what I can show you here there are coconuts, oranges, lime - and probably a lot more that I don't know of yet. When we start putting cattle on the farm we will get easier access to many areas. Plus we will do some weeding and then we should be able to create some inventory and a map to know what grows where. It's a big place and you don't grasp it all in a few days.

There is a segment of pasture that is full of Guava trees and these trees carry a lot of fruits. It is said that cattle likes Guava as well and of course they distribute it all over the place. We have to figure out how we can let them have fun and enjoy a good Guava harvest ourselves.
