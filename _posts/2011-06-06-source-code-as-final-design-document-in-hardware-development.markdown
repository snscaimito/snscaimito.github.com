Sometimes it makes a lot of sense to look outside one's own box. Who would have know that in hardware design they actually use a programming language to produce the final work product of the design process for a new chip design. The language is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog">Verilog</a>.

The new chip design expressed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog">Verilog</a> is verified using simulators and if everything works as intended, it is sent off to manufacturing where the actual physical chip is built.

Interesting ... isn't it?
