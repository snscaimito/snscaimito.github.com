After successfully testing our homemade trailer off the road we decided that we should add the doors on all four sides now. This morning Luis welded the doors using steel rectangular tubes and the same mesh that we used for the platform.

He also connected the security chain. It is still a bit long and needs to be cut I think. I want it to be that short that in case the trailers comes off the hitch it won't touch ground but instead keeps hanging in the air.

Another addition that's on the list is lights for brake and turn signal. And the trailer needs a license plate so that we can legally use it on the highway.
