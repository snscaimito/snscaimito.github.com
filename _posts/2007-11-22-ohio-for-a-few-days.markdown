<p>After speaking in Tampa and Miami at the beginning of this week I flew to Columbus, Ohio, yesterday night to visit my good friend Brian Sam-Bodden of <a href="http://www.integrallis.com">Integrallis</a>. What a difference between warm and sunny Florida ;-) As you can tell by the picture, snapped this morning, winter is coming and the temperature has already dropped quite a bit. While in Miami and Tampa it was about 27&ordm;C/80&ordm;C here in Ohio it's only 4&ordm;C/40&ordm;F, which to me is not chilly but actually quite cold.</p>

<p>That temperature thing is particularly funny, as I, being German, should be used to low temperatures and show. Apparently the human adapts quite good to different climates. Now that I live in warmer places, such as Florida, the Dominican Republic and now Panama, my body has adapted to heat and I need to put on more warm clothes than I used to in the past. Quite funny this experience ;-)</p>
