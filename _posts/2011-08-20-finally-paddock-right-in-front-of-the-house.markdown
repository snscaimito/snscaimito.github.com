Today I'm very a very happy person. The picture above shows the new paddock right in front of the house. This is the first 2000 square meter piece. More will follow further to the right. Now I have my horse always in sight and just about 25 meters to walk to catch them and go for a ride. This is all brand new and a few details are still missing. One thing is to have water there. For the moment we have to use a bucket but then it's not far away. The next step is to install some water pipe and then use a garden hose to wash them and provide drinking water.
