<p>After a week of talks with high-ranking government officials and opposition leaders Prima Panama, a real estate developer, reports:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://primapanama.blogs.com/_panama_residential_devel/">Panama Residential Developers Blog</a> in <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/primapanama/_panama_residential_devel/~3/129161533/paradise-recove.html">Paradise recovered-Friday update</a>:<br>
It&rsquo;s been less than a week since we starting receiving responses to our Internet survey and we&rsquo;ve already achieved some spectacular results.&#160; Our sources in the Assembly have informed us that legislation is being introduced to return the length of stay for the tourist visa to 90-days (without requiring an extension) and issuing a temporary extension of the 20-year tax exemption on new property until December 31st, 2007. We have assurances that it has the full support of the President along with his cabinet.

<p>At the very least it's interesting to see that in this small country (only 3 million citizens) it is possible to get into direct talks with the government. I can't predict what the outcome of all this will be, but my feeling is that the government will come up with some exception for European and North-American visitors while maintaining the 30 days limit for everyone else.</p>
