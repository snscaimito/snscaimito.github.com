By the end of June our windows showed up and were installed. They are factory made in Poland and then shipped to Spain where a local installer put them in. Although this is a do-it-yourself project we feel it doesn't make sense to try to do *everything* yourself. Where there is nothing to be gained from learning a particular skill the job can be left to those who already know how to do it. On a farm there is a lot of need for woodworking and soldering skills but not for window installation.

With the windows and door in the office already looks like it will be ready for business shortly.

The bedroom also changed it's look and feel. Windows make everything feel much more like a real house.

The south wall has limited window space in order to prevent the house from heating up too much. There is plenty of light coming in from the east and west sides.
