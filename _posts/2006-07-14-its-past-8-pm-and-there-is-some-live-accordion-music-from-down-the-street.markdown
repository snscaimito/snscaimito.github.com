<p>What a country? It's past 8 pm and I'm still sitting in my office here in Panama City just next to the banking area. A tropical rain shower for almost an hour has stopped 30 minutes ago and I can hear some live accordion music from down the street. Unfortunately I can't see who is playing, but it's just great. And it's still not Friday afternoon when folks leave work and start partying.</p>
