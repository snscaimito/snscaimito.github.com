Today we were visited by several insect that have their body shaped like a green leaf. I was able to snap a picture and like to share it.

<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://stephanschwab.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_0067.jpg" alt="DSC 0067" title="DSC_0067.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="398" />

This is a living creature.
