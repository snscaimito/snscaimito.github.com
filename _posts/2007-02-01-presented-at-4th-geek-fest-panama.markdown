<p>This evening I enjoyed the forth <a href="http://www.geekfestpanama.com">Geek Fest Panama</a> and contributed with a talk about the SCRUM methodology for agile development in Spanish (<a href="/files/SCRUM-Espanol.pdf">slides as PDF</a>).</p>

<p>After the presentations everybody started networking and talking about geeky stuff. I enjoyed very much the interest in my favorite topics (SCRUM and advanced Java development) and had some good conversations with a number of interesting people.</p>

<p>Lots of pictures were taken as well. I'll see where they will be posted and will then update this blog entry with some links.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here is a <a href="http://www.ryze.com/geek/images/event4/SANY0068.JPG">picture of me</a> (on the left) talking with two Panamanians about Java development.</p>
