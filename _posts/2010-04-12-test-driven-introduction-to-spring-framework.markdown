Today I started to teach a 5 day training course about Spring Framework. This is not the usual course though. It is based on test-driven development (TDD) and is taught online. I have 8 students distributed over the United States and I teach the course from my home in Panama up in the mountains. We've started today and I'm pretty sure that some student with a sharp ear has heard the birds chirping in the background. I think that's kind of nice.

Thanks to my friends at <a href="http://www.integrallis.com">Integrallis</a> and <a href="http://knowledgeunited.com">Knowledge United</a> for providing me the opportunity. I'm looking forward to teach this course frequently througout this year.
