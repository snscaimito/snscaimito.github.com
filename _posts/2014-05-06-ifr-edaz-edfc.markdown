This is another account of an IFR flight from Berlin-Schönhagen (EDAZ) to Aschaffenburg (EDFC). The flight took 1:35 hours from takeoff to touchdown.

I continue to document these experiences in order to learn from it. One thing is to learn in the IFR training environment where ATC is mostly simulated by the flight instructor in the right seat. Another thing is to experience it for real while doing longer cross-country flights alone. I consider the latter the real learning opportunity and the more I observe and mentally process, the better my foundation for the future use of the tool "light aircraft for business travel" is going to be.

## IFR flight plan

My IFR flight plan was for 1645Z, which translates to 18:45 local time. My actual off-block time was 18:56 local time, as I had, again, a hard time getting out of the Berlin city traffic and on the road to Schönhagen. I left the office of my client at 17:00, was driving by about 17:15, which means that in the afternoon it takes basically the same amount of time to get from the center of Berlin to Schönhagen as does the flight from Schönhagen to Aschaffenburg.

By 19:08 local time I was airborne.

## Initial climb out

 and after the initial climb out of Schönhagen I called ATC

_Berlin Departure N747TG airborne Schönhagen passing 2000ft_

and added a request for a routing further south to avoid the heavy precipitation over Magdeburg. I was told to continue towards MAG, the Magdeburg VOR, and climb FL80. A few seconds later the controller informed me about the limit of my clearance according to my filed route: PEKIG. 

What then followed was interesting.

From the tone of her voice I could tell the controller was a bit nervous or distracted. She was providing information in pieces, as she was probably trying to work out a solution for my request with her assistant while communicating with me and other pilots in her sector.

I was past FL70 and on my way up the last 1000ft to FL80 when I noticed that at FL80 I will probably be right inside the bottom of a cloud layer at below 0C. As I was still headed towards Magdeburg where the heavy precipitation was, I called her back to request going back to FL70, which was granted immediately. She also instructed me to _proceed direct TAMEB_. TAMEB is a waypoint south of Erfurt and part of my filed route.

I was then handed off to Munich RADAR and got

_NTG proceed direct DEMAB._
