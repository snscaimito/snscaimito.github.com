<p>An interesting find:</p>

<blockquote>Mary Poppendieck in <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/leanagilescrum/message/830">Another perspective on Command and Control</a>:<br>
<p>Take a look at this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.carlisle.army.mil/pksoi/StaticDocuments/Army/fm6.pdf">http://www.carlisle.army.mil/pksoi/StaticDocuments/Army/fm6.pdf</a></p>

<p>Scroll to page 30 (1-15) and look at Figure 1.4.&#160; This shows that there are two concepts of command and control:&#160; Mission command and Detailed command.&#160; Mission command is what we want, Detailed command is what doesn&rsquo;t work.&#160; Both are considered different techniques of command and control.&#160; One kind of command and control is about telling people what to do, and the other kind of command and control is about organizing the environment and the people so that the mission is clear and effectively accomplished.&#160;</p>

<p>I think using the word &ldquo;command and control&rdquo; as a pejorative is too simplistic, as is assuming that self-organizing teams is the one antidote to solve all problems.</p>
