By way of the <a href="http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/">Rainforest Alliance</a> I came across the <a href="http://sanstandards.org">Sustainable Agriculture Network</a>. They are developing and promoting a standard for sustainable cattle farming. At first glance it looks like a good thing. So I registered to read and comment on the standard they are developing.
