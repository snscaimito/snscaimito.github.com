<p><a href="http://www.stephan-schwab.com/2007/11/24/1195930292349.html">Earlier today</a> I cited from another blog and remarked that craming the team in a small space to me seems to be too distracting. Here is another comment on the same topic:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://vladimirlevin.blogspot.com/">Vladimir Levin</a> in <a href="http://vladimirlevin.blogspot.com/2007/11/pair-programming.html">Pair Programming Redux</a>:<br>
My conclusion is that pair programming does work, but it requires some care. First, developers have to respect each other and be willing to compromise. Also, pair programming 100% of the time doesn't work. Sometimes when facing a design problem it helps to go off and work separately, then get back together and discuss later. Also, pair programming - constantly communicating, asking questions, explaining and justifying one's own ideas throughout the day - is very demanding. After a period of time, burnout can occur. When that happens, I think it's a good idea for people to be able to work on something alone for a while.
