<p>After seeing enough of this <em>fantastic</em> view out of our city apartment (left picture) we decided to move to a nicer place.</p>

<p>Less noise, no pollution, no traffic jams - only the sounds of birds, grasshoppers and other animals. So now I have the view in the first picture. Panama, as all the other countries in Central America, is a mountainous place. It's always up and down once you leave the beach areas and the Interamerican Highway running East to West through the Istmus.</p>

<p>The city is not bad per se. On a sunny day there are many nice places where you can sit, have a drink and enjoy people watching. But it's always some kind of commercial activity you are taking part in. Those places are businesses and you are a paying customer. Nature doesn't charge you for enjoying the view and fresh air.</p>

<p>It took me almost two months to get the proper vehicle for explorations of our new surroundings shipped from the US to Panama and out of customs. Shipping was fast. A week after the purchase it was on the ship sailing across the Carribean Sea to Panama. Then a long ordeal began and when I have some extra time and someone buys me a good beer I'm going to tell the story. It's long and winded and one more time proves that electronics (TV, stereos, computers) and cars receive a special treatment at customs. Seems these things are high profile merchandise.</p>

<p>But anyway ... I got it out of customs before the holidays, we could relocate and I even had some time to explore our immediate surroundings off the regular roads.</p>
