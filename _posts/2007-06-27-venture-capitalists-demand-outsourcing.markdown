<blockquote><a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired Magazine</a> in <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=2">The Micro-Multinational</a>:<br>
Venture capitalists now routinely demand that the companies they finance outsource what labor they can. Yogen Dalal, a partner at Mayfield, says more than half the companies he funds have offshore workers. The Valley even has a name for these startups: micro-multinationals.

<p>That's some very interesting idea. Further down in the article it says:</p>

<blockquote>The president and chief executive of Solidcore, Rosen Sharma, is an unapologetic fan of outsourcing. "We were a micro-multinational from day one. It didn't mean I hired fewer people in the US," he says. "It meant that I could hire more people in sales and marketing, because I didn't have to concentrate on building R&amp;D in America."</blockquote>

<p>So, if you are a startup company working on some consumer oriented project or other project where you would like to do more in marketing and sales, you might want to consider outsourcing to a place nearby and within your timezone. My company <a href="http://www.caimito.net">Caimito Technologies</a> operates out of an office in Panama (2.5 hours south of Miami; next to the famous Panama Canal) and we might be able help to you with your development efforts.</p>
