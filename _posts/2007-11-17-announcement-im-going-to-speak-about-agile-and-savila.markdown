<p>This is a first for me. Starting next week I'm going to speak about how to set up an agile development organization and will demo our agile project management tool Savila.</p>

<p>The first presentation will be in Tampa, Florida, on November 19th. Here is the <a href="http://www.tampajug.org/2007/11/november-2007-tampa-jug-meeting.html">announcement of the Tampa JUG</a> with more details about the venue. Thanks to Vladimir Vivian for the invitation.</p>

<p>On November 20th I will be in Miami to participate as a speaker at the Miami JUG. See the <a href="http://miamijug.wordpress.com/events/">JUG's event page</a> for details. I'd like to thank Fermin Ordaz for the opportunity to speak.</p>

<p>A few days later I'll be in Atlanta giving another talk about Agile and Savila, but this time with focus on Java in Latin America. My thanks to the members of the Atlanta JUG and Gunnar Hillert for their interest in learning about software development in Latin America.</p>

<p>For those of you who may have stumbled upon this post without knowing much about my background some explanation: some time ago I left my home country Germany for personal reasons and happened to settled down in the Republic of Panama after trying out a few other places. Here in Panama I founded a company called <a href="http://www.caimito.net">Caimito</a> and am training young Panamanians fresh out of University the skills to become <em>rock star</em> software developers. We develop an agile project management tool called Savila. Due to this I can tell a bit about software development in this part of the world. And I can say: it's been quite good so far.</p>
