<p>Last Friday I got <a href="http://www.stephan-schwab.com/generateTrackBackLink.action?entry=1221003943679">invited</a> to speak at an event organized by IEEE Panama at the Universidad Tecnologica en Panama City, Panama. It was a pleasant experience to talk with students about passionate software development. The topic of my talk was Agile Development. For this special event I tried to tailor the talk towards the needs of students in their last year of college to give them some orientation and outlook. </p>

<p>Who's interested may <a href="/files/DesarrolloSoftwareIEEE-UTP-September-2008.pdf">download the slides</a> I used. It's all in Spanish and the presentation itself was short on purpose to allow more room for conversations. </p>

<p>Reports - with pictures - by others about the event:</p>
