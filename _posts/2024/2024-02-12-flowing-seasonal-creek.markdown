title: Flowing Seasonal Creek
description: "After some 50 liters of rain over the last two days I went out with the camera to document how the seasonal #creek looks like. The YouTube community around Project Granja Caimito had been making a lot of good suggestions on how to improve that creek for better #water #retention and today was a great opportunity to add some real world data to it and show how past modifications of the creek work with flowing water."

After some 50 liters of #rain over the last two days I went out with the camera to document how the seasonal #creek looks like. The YouTube community around [Project Granja Caimito](https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectGranjaCaimito) had been making a lot of good suggestions on how to improve that creek for better #water #retention and today was a great opportunity to add some real world data to it and show how past modifications of the creek work with flowing water.

In the video I also talk about the catchment area on the neighbor's land and further improvements that we want to make once we have a big excavator and dump truck here.
