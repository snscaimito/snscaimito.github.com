<p>Now at the beginning of the afternoon it's Keith Donald's second talk about Domain Driven Design at The Spring Experience.</p>

<p>Effective modeling is about creating a knowledge rich model with everything <strong>relevant</strong> to the problem being solved. In order to achieve this one has to develop a common language so that everybody involved has a chance to stay on the same page. It's about brainstorming and experimenting using tools such as unit tests and the IDE. The idea is to write code very early, but for the time being leave questions of the infrastructure out.</p>

<p>Domain experts and developers need to work together. Only I believe that most domain experts don't have the time to follow that approach. So in the end it will be about showing a simplistic prototype to them. Something that appears to be working, although underneath there is no functionality that can really be put into production. I see a few questions here.</p>

<p>Once you understand enough of the domain problem, write some code. Focus on behavior, avoid all infrastructure. Then get some feedback from users. Again I see some questions here. The idea is certainly a good one, but will the users accept being shown something that is purely a simulation? Some non-technical people tend to expect real working software dealing with real data at an early stage. So here will be certainly some need to explain things to them.</p>
