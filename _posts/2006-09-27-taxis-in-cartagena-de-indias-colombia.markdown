<p>It's not the first time I visit Colombia. But this time a lot of things have changed. The city was heavily remodeled and there is still construction work going on at a lot of places. </p>

<p>Taxis in Colombia always have been yellow. In most Latin American countries they use cars with regular paint, so you have to spot the taxi sign on top of the car.</p>

<p>What has changed is that they now use only newer cars. A couple of years back some taxis were almost a moving wreck, but now everything is new they feature a big replica of the license plate on the doors of each side and even a bigger one the top. The one on the top is probably meant to be seen clearly from the air.</p>

<p>There are more changes visible in the streets. I'll try to take a few more pictures today before we leave tomorrow morning.</p>
