Our house is made of wood. That, however, does not mean that all the wood gets exposed to the weather. The wood provides the structural elements but is not on the outside. To protect the wood and to ensure no wind or water can come through the walls we wrap the house in a membrane. It allows moisture to go out but no water to come in.

The paper gets rolled out and fixed to the plywood with staples.

For the window openings we cut into the paper and fold it back before using staples to hold it in place.

Later the windows will sit on the paper and with adhesive tape and foam we create the seal around the windows.
