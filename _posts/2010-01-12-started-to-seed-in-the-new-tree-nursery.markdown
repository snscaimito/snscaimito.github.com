It's not a big announcement but still a bit important. We now have a number of little bags with dirt and seeds in them at our new tree nursery. We started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_orange">mandarin orange</a>. Other species will follow shortly.

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34665899@N00/4269749898" title="View '' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" width="500" alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4269749898_ab40b3a1c6.jpg"></a></div>

In about three months from now we should be able to plant the young trees at the farm.
