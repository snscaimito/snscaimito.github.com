There has always been the plan to [have horses again](/horses/). With the abundance of gras in early May we not only got a [few sheep](/2018/06/26/we-got-four-merino-sheep.html) but also a white Andalucian horse. The horse is a 12 years old gelding and his name is Apollo. Upon bringing him up the house he immediately enjoyed munching on the fresh gras.

We were also happy to see an increase in wildlife. Here is a picture of a land turtle that lives in the creek that borders the farm. Juan was able to snap this pretty good picture:
