<p>On Tuesday, 20th of November 2007, the Miami Java Users Group gave me the opportunity to speak about Agile and our project management tool <a href="http://www.caimito.net">Savila</a>. Unlike the day before in Tampa I was the third speaker in a row and we had to timebox our presentations a bit. So this presentation is a bit shorter than the one I <a href="http://www.stephan-schwab.com/2007/11/22/1195766926900.html">delivered in Tampa</a>. Here is the presentation as PDF for <a href="http://www.stephan-schwab.com/files/AgileDevelopmentOrganizationMiami.pdf">download</a>.</p>

<p>The audience was of similar size, about 35 persons, and although we had to finish more or less on time we had some lively discussions about TDD and agile estimation techniques.</p>

<p>Many thanks to all of you in Miami.</p>
