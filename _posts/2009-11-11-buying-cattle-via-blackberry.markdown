While I write this Luis is at the cattle auction in Capira. Unfortunately I can't be there personally due to other obgligations. So we employ some 21st century technology to allow me to be virtually there. Luis just took a few pictures of young calves that are being offered on his Blackberry phone.

The auction just started and the animals are on display in some holding area from where they get brought to a stage with a scale in front of the audience.

The auction is about price per pound which then gets multiplied by the weight of the animal to determine the actual price.

They look quite small. I've got only these pictures a few minutes ago but they look like 10 months old.
