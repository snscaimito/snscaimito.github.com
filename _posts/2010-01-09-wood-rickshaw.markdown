Reading this you may think we have a tick for trailers. And all get painted yellow. Well... Somehow this is true. We build this one a few months back when a friend who owns a teak plantation asked us to help him thin the plantation. It never got used behind a horse which was the original intention. The terrain was too wet by the time and we did not want to risk a broken horse leg or other kind of accident.

Now we are in the dry season and a device with wheels might help us to move logs - which are 2m in length - around. This thing is balanced and should move forward easily regardless of the load put onto it. Tomorrow we'll see how it will perform.
