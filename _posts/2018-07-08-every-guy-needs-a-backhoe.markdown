In Permaculture earthworks is an important design tool. The retention of water is a key element. Here in the Mediterranean climate water retention is even more important - it does not rain at all for several months per year. Sooner or later we will have to use some heavy equipment for moving dirt and reshape the landscape.

Besides that... Isn't it that boys always like toys and the toys grows but not the boy? :-) Well... I'm an older guy now but I can still play with big toys. Allow me to introduce our new to us [New Holland backhoe model NH 75](http://www.ritchiespecs.com/specification?type=Constructio&category=Loader+Backhoe&make=New+Holland&model=LB75.B&modelid=92017).
