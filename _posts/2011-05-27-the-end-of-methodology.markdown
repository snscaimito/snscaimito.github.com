<blockquote>
	We have finally matured. What we now produce are Reflective Improvement Frameworks, not methodologies (though we often still say that out of habit). Crystal, Scrum, Kapital-K Kanban are examples. Each contains a few rules, not enough to run a project, but enough for people to improve their situation better than merely inspecting and adapting. Old-style Big-M Methodologies are gone. And thatâ€™s good.
