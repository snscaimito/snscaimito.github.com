<p>Ever wondered why Windows is so dominant in developing countries? Have a look at this statement from Bill Gates himself:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://money.cnn.com">CNN Money</a> in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/07/23/100134488/">How Microsoft conquered China - July 23, 2007</a>:<br>
Today Gates openly concedes that tolerating piracy turned out to be Microsoft's best long-term strategy. That's why Windows is used on an estimated 90% of China's 120 million PCs. "It's easier for our software to compete with Linux when there's piracy than when there's not," Gates says. [...] Indeed, in China's back alleys, Linux often costs more than Windows because it requires more disks.
</blockquote>

<p>The same can be observed here in Panama. Everybody uses Windows and most of the times it's a pirated copy. Linux users are not found easily. It should be just the contrary. Maybe in a future post I should elaborate a bit more on the opportunities that arise when people in developing countries use Free Software and Open Source software instead of committing crimes out of laziness.</p>
