The last few weeks have been quite busy. Taking care of all the little things after you relocate consumes a lot of time and you end up doing it on the weekends, because you have to work during the week. So there was virtually no time for a leisurely stroll around town or anything similar.

But this Sunday we finally could enjoy our new surroundings and I thought it would be a nice idea to let everybody interested come along as well. So I've created a new photo gallery called [Panama City Impressions](/img/posts/PanamaCityImpressions).
