<p>The last few weeks weren't easy. My wife and I had to spent all the time in Germany due to an emergency in our family there. That postponed our relocation to Panama.</p>

<p>This week all our stuff from the home and office gets packed into boxes. Monday we're expecting the 40' container that will be shipped to Panama the same day. It will travel across the Caribbean Sea for a week and then trucked from the port to Panama City.</p>

<p>I expect to proceed with my work from my Panama office by July 10th. During my last trip in late May air conditioning and Internet access were installed. I bought a temporary desk and office chair as well and brought some equipment there. So there should be nothing preventing me from getting productive once I've arrived. Let's hope no new surprises show up ;-)</p>
