As I mentioned before our neighbor Didimo offered to take care of our horses and store our gear in his old home. Let me show you the place. It's a very simply wooden structure with a tin roof. It has no windows but some kind of a shutter in place of a window.

For lunch we come back to this place to light a fire for a nice barbeque. These "light a bag" things are great. We've stored a few there and I can confirm that this is the easiest and cleanest way you can find.

In the background you can see Pedron (white) and Luzero (brown). There are a few mango trees and all the horses like the fruits. If we don't tie them to a tree, they will roam the place and you can hear the sound of them squashing the fruits with their teath. They have an interesting technique for eating fruits and even manage to take a good part of the juice in.

We use a marinated Panamanian version of Rib Eye. It has a good flavor and we don't really need any kind of side. After all we don't have any table but we do eat from plates and with fork and knife. Not as on the other day when we could not cross the second river. That day we simply used a stick. See next picture :-)

Here it is. Of course I was posing but I take it you will believe me that I was really, really hungry that day. I guess it depends on the place and the situation :-) It was fun and good for a nice story.
