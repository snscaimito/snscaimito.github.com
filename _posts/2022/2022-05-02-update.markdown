Well... It has been a long while since I posted something here. Some might even think
that something has happened or that I've lost interested in the topics I've written about before.

Everything is just fine and a lot of positive things have happened. Quite a lot. Actually that much that there wasn't any time or power left to start writing here.

I've been doing a lot of videos instead of writing articles.

The site `granja.caimito.net` does not exist anymore. Instead there will be a new one in a while.
