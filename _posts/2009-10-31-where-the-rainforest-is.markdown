This blog is about a farm in the rainforest of Panama. So where is that rainforest? It is actually all around us. Only to the south the forest has been cleared a long time ago.

Here is a series of pictures showing forest next to the farm and on the borders of it. You can very well see that the tropical forest has several layers.

In those trees are quite a lot of monkeys. Unfortunately I don't have a lens to capture a picture of them. They do a lot of noise though.

Large birds like Tucans can be seen too.

The forest on top of this hill and its flanks is part of the piece of the farm that we did the survey for. We had to climb on top of it following a barb wire fence that separates our farm from our neighbor's.
