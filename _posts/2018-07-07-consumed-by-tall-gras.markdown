The month of May saw our little house almost be consumed by tall gras growing everywhere on the farm.

We began putting up the sheet metal roofing and also added an electric fence to keep [the horse](/2018/07/07/getting-a-horse-and-some-wildlife.html) close to the construction activities in order to be exposed and used to sounds and movements that otherwise might be frightening to him.

As it became difficult to move around the house we cut down the gras with a gas-powered trimmer.

We kept the trimming close to the house so that we don't take away the food for the animals. We later let the sheep eat the rest, which worked out very well.
