<p>That's an interesting find for everything you loves agile development practices. CNN Money has ranked "agile" #18 on its "Top 50 Who Matter Now" list. That might get the agile idea on the radar of more business people. So in general it's a good thing.</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://money.cnn.com">CNN Money</a> in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/biz2/0706/gallery.50whomatter.biz2/33.html">The 50 Who Matter Now - Agile Software Development (33) - Business 2.0</a>:<br>
Agile teams work very quickly -- sometimes in as little as a week -- to create small chunks of code. Once a component is finished, additional features are added, with the process repeating indefinitely.
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately they use "A new approach to Web-based code" as their second headline and connect "agile" to web-based services in the text. That might cause the business person reading this to believe that "agile" is something limited to everything web while in fact it's simply a way of doing all <a href="http://www.reformingprojectmanagement.com/2007/06/26/815/">kinds of projects</a> and not even software alone.</p>
