<p>This Sunday we decided to <em>cogerlo suave</em> (take it easy) and went over the Las Americas bridge to Playa Veracruz. The whole trip took about 30 minutes and the difference could not have been bigger. So we exchanged the city view for a more exotic looking one as seen in the second picture.</p>
