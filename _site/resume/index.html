					<h1>Professional experience of Stephan Schwab</h1>
					<p>Based on my first lines of code written in the early 1980s and first publication in <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Persönlich">Computer Persönlich</a> I’ve been honing my skills in software development and business since then.</p>

<p>My passion is software development in multiple programming languages and thanks to my demanding clients I keep up with current technologies being languages, frameworks and also networking, operating systems or operations topics.</p>

<p>Unlike some of my peers in Agile Coaching I have never stopped programming personally and so I can do for real what I talk about. In every engagement that ability earns me quickly respect and people like to take my advice as it comes from the trenches and not from books or lectures.</p>

<p>I help CEOs and Department Leaders to improve value creation and cohesion within their organization. The outcome will be higher quality, customer delight and more revenue.</p>

<p>Agility and self-organization require technical competence. Scrum, Kanban and other frameworks and concepts do not work without technical abilities. I help everybody involved to acquire or grow these abilities.</p>

<p>My contributions help the organization to become more adaptable and more resilient so that it can prevail in global dynamic markets that are constantly changing.</p>

<p>My work, on an international level, gets me in touch with many different national and corporate cultures. That allows me to see the bigger picture, provides me a large arsenal of tools and therefore makes me able to solve difficult situations in a way that is new to the particular client I’m working with.</p>

<p>A good example illustrating some of my more special experiences is this story:</p>

<blockquote>
I taught a young developer in China at Huawei Behavior-Driven Development in Python using the framework <a href="https://github.com/behave/behave">Behave</a>. She did not speak a lot of English and we were communicating through a translator who was sitting between us. As I was able to show in code what I was explaining in English - the translator turning my words into Mandarin - my coachee quickly understood the concepts and we were able to deliver a valuable service to her team.

	<dd>
		<p class="client">2022 - 2023, Caimito Agile Life, Spain</p>
		<img src="../img/granjaEU-menu.jpg" style="width: 8em; float: right; margin-left: 2em" />
		<p>This is a solo project with no other people involved.</p>
		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.caimito.eu">CaimitoEU</a> is a frontend application to promote an ecosystem restoration project in Andalusia, Spain. The application contains a shop for packaged products and also an innovative butcher shop to facilitate the sale of fresh Iberico meat.</p>
		<p>It is written in JavaScript with VueJS (version 3), HTML5 and CSS3 for styling. After a bad experience with TailwindCSS the styling was redone in pure CSS3. It is deployed as a Docker container with an NGINX reverse proxy in the front and for handling SSL encryption. CaimitoEU consumes an API provided by GranjaEU and does not have local data storage.</p>
		<p>Secured via Keycloak, CaimitoEU calls the backend API REST endpoints authenticating itself as a service account.</p>
		<p>To process payments PayPal is integrated. CaimitoEU displays information in English, German, Spanish languages via vue-i18n and some Vue Router tricks to redirect to language specific pages for larger content.</p>
		<p>Build and deploy happen via GitHub Actions to a staging and production environment. The multi-stage build includes Cypress UI tests and also Cypress smoke tests before a candidate container is marked as ready for deployment.</p>
		<p>More complex features that take longer in development are controlled via feature flags in order to make them visible in the staging but not in the production environment.</p>

		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.granja.eu">GranjaEU</a> is the backend API for CaimitoEU and also a small-scale ERP system for running a farm which is being used daily by the workers of Granja Caimito.</p>
		<p>The backend API is coded in Java with Spring Boot. It exposes REST endpoints to the GranjaEU webapp and also a secured public API, via Keycloak, for CaimitoEU (in the future, other farm applications as well).</p>
		<p>User management is done within Keycloak. Data is stored either structured in PostgreSQL or as documents in MongoDB.</p>
		<p>The user interface is made with Vuetify and supports English and Spanish languages via vue-i18n.</p>
		<p>GranjaEU also sends emails via JavaMail and the Google SMTP server to customers in response to shop actions and to notify customers about state changes for their orders.</p>

		<p>Test-driven development and rapid prototyping are two of the methods used. Actual farm workers use the application at a very early stage and provide feedback. Deployment to production - in the sense of trunk-based development - for both applications happens multiple times per day in small chunks.</p>

		<p>As with CaimitoEU build and deploy happen via GitHub Actions as a multi-stage build pipeline. Maven is building and running a large number of JUnit unit and integration tests. Cypress is used to test the GranjaEU web UI and also runs smoke tests of the deployed application for selected critical functionality. The output is several Docker containers which are stored at GitHub's container registry and deployed via SSH to a Docker Compose to staging and production environments.</p>

		<p>All servers running Docker Engine based on Debian Linux are maintained by myself.</p>

		<p>Technologies: VueJS, Vuetify, Cypress, Keycloak (OAuth2), Docker (compose), MongoDB, PostgreSQL, NGINX, Spring Boot (REST, Data, Mail, Thymeleaf, Security), Flyway, JUnit, Maven</p>
