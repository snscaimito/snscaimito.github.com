title: Living and working in the United States of America

In 2004 my wife and I left Germany for Miami, Florida to start a business there.

We picked Miami as we thought that might be a good place to live due to the heavy Latin American influence. And it turned out that with a few exceptions Spanish was the main language that we used everywhere.

After several months in the [Dominican Republic](/dominican-republic.html) during 2005 we returned to retrieve our belongs from a storage facility in Miami and moved to Tampa, which is located further north in Florida. This time the primary language was English.

In late 2011 we returned to the U.S. to live and work in Columbus, Ohio and also in Buffalo, New York. We even got two horses and a real pickup truck.

Due to some circumstances we left the U.S. after only a few months for Europe in late 2012.
